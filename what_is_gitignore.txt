gitignore is used to specify what files can be ignored in a git repo.
For example, if one is using an IDE that creates configuration files, other developers don't care about these and so you would include them in a gitignore file so they are ignored.
This means when you run git status, the result will look pretty and not cluttered up by files you don't want to upload to git.
